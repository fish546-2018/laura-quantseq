For QuantSeq FWD data we therefore recommend using an aligner that can perform soft-clipping of the read ends (e.g., STAR aligner) during alignment, or increasing the number of allowed mismatches to 14. Alternatively, trimming the first 12 nt of Read 1 can be performed prior to alignment when using a more stringent aligner (e.g., HISAT2). While trimming the read can decrease the number of reads of suitable length for alignment, the absolute number of mapping reads may increase due to the improved read quality._\n",

    "The QuantSeq data analysis pipeline recommends using the [STAR aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR): \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.12 Which aligner should be used for data analysis?**\n",
    "STAR aligner is recommended for mapping QuantSeq FWD (Cat.No. 015) data. The reads may not land in the last exon and span a junction. Reads should be trimmed prior to alignment to remove poly(A) tails and sequencing adapters (see FAQ. 1.13 below).\n",
    "More information on the data analysis can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.13 What sequence should be trimmed?**\n",
    "The reads should be trimmed to remove adapter sequences, poly(A) / poly(T) sequences, and low quality nucleotides. Reads that are too short (i.e., <20 nt) or have generally low quality scores should be removed from the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As second strand synthesis is based on random priming, there may be a higher proportion of errors at the first nucleotides of the insert due to non-specific hybridization of the random primer to the cDNA template. **For QuantSeq FWD data we therefore recommend using an aligner that can perform soft-clipping of the read ends (e.g., STAR aligner) during alignment, or increasing the number of allowed mismatches to 14.** Alternatively, trimming the first 12 nt of Read 1 can be performed prior to alignment when using a more stringent aligner (e.g., HISAT2). While trimming the read can decrease the number of reads of suitable length for alignment, the absolute number of mapping reads may increase due to the improved read quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "More about STAR in [Dobin et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635) & [Dobin et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3572-7_13)\n",

    "I downloaded STAR using the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "    cd /Applications/bioinformatics/\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR.git  # download STAR repo to my bioinf. app folder\n",

    "I tried installing STAR following the directions on GitHub, using the following, but to no avail: \n",
