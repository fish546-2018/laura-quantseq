
Test files:  
- oly_Trinityv2.txt is just raw read counts mapped to each gene in an assembled transcriptome. This was obtained following Misha Matz's scripts for the most part.
- trinity_go_annotations.txt is the Gene Ontology annotations for those genes (not every gene was annotated).
- DeSeq2_Oyster_Trinity-clean.ipynb is an R Jupyter notebook showing my initial attempts to analyze differential gene expression using the R package DeSeq2. If you figure out a different approach you like, please let me know as I'm still figuring out the best way to approach this data too.
- CP-KS-Lib3-SN-31G_S18_L008_R1_001.fastq - this is a QuantSeq file that may be one of my samples (SN?), but I'm not sure. Using as test file for now.
