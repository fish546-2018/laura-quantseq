_Important text from a 
[Github issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-olympia.oyster-genomic/issues/34#event-1497598684) with communications between Katherine Silliman and myself, explaining samples sent to her for sequencing_

---

Here is the data sheet with info for the selected samples (and a few back-ups) - I've included a few comments on the Excel file with explanations.

For quick reference, here are the 24 samples I selected. Feel free to call tomorrow with questions!:
