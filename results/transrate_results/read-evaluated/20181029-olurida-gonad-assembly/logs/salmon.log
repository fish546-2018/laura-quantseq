[2018-11-08 19:55:46.970] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2369375 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-11-08 19:55:53.273] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2369375 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-11-08 19:55:53.273] [jointLog] [warning] Since only 2369375 (< 5000000) fragments were observed, modeling of the fragment start position distribution has been disabled
